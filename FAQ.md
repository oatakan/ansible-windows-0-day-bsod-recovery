# Ansible Windows BSoD Recovery: FAQ

## What is this project all about?

This Ansible project automates the recovery of Windows systems from Blue Screen of Death (BSoD) errors. It leverages Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform (AAP) to provide a streamlined, cross-platform approach for handling various BSoD scenarios. It was inspired by a real-world incident but designed to be adaptable for different causes of BSoDs.

## How does this project work?

The project uses a two-step approach:

1. **WinPE Generation**
   A custom Windows Preinstallation Environment (WinPE) ISO image is created, incorporating specific recovery scripts tailored to address the identified BSoD issue.

2. **Recovery Execution**
   Ansible playbooks automate the process of booting the affected virtual machine into the WinPE environment, executing the recovery script, and rebooting the system. This separation of recovery logic (within the WinPE ISO) and execution process ensures flexibility and adaptability for different BSoD scenarios.

## What virtualization platforms are supported?

The project currently supports:

- VMware vSphere
- OpenShift Virtualization (KubeVirt)

It demonstrates how Ansible Automation Platform can interact with different virtualization platforms to provide consistent recovery operations.

## Can I adapt this project for different BSoD issues?

Yes! The modular design allows you to customize the recovery script embedded within the WinPE ISO. This means you can address a variety of BSoD causes by tailoring the recovery logic without modifying the main execution playbooks.

## Is there a demonstration available?

Yes, you can find video demonstrations showcasing the automated recovery process for both VMware vSphere and OpenShift Virtualization on the project's GitHub repository.

## Where can I find the project code and documentation?

The complete project code, documentation, and instructions for use are available on the project's GitHub repository. You can find the link to the repository in the original source material provided.

## How can I contribute to the project?

The project maintainers welcome community involvement! You can contribute by sharing your ideas, suggesting new features, reporting issues, or submitting code changes through the project's GitHub repository.

## What are the benefits of using this automated approach?

Automating the BSoD recovery process with Ansible offers several advantages:

- **Rapid Response**: Quickly address system failures and minimize downtime.
- **Consistency**: Ensure standardized recovery procedures across your environment.
- **Scalability**: Handle recovery operations for a large number of affected systems.
- **Reduced Manual Effort**: Free up IT teams from tedious manual tasks and reduce the risk of human error.
- **Adaptability**: Easily customize the solution to address various BSoD scenarios and evolving needs.
